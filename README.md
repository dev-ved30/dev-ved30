## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student at Northwestern University's <b>Department of Physics and Astronomy</b> and at the <b>Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA)</b>, working at the intersection of time domain astronomy, machine learning, and statistics. Specifically, I am building state of the art machine learning classification and anomaly detection systems for current and future astrophysical surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

I graduated with <b>James Scholar Honors</b> from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Astronomy and a minor in Statistics. 
At Illinois, I was awarded the <b>2024 Stanley Wyatt Memorial Award</b>, given "to the graduating Astronomy major or minor with the most outstanding GPA and track record of 
undergraduate research." During my time there, I also received <b>2021 LSSTC Science Catalyst Grant</b> and the <b>2024 Preble Scholarship</b> for my research in multi-messenger astronomy and machine learning. My senior thesis research involved modelling kilonova discovery rates and developing new machine learning methods to find rare transients.

Previously, I have interned in both research and software engineering roles at Country Financial, the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and 
IIT Bombay. Fundamentally, I am interested in applying computational methods to solve scientific problems. In particular, I am interested in machine learning, 
scientific computing, and back-end software development.
